    > sudo apt-get purge cmake

2. Go to the official CMake webpage, then download and extract the latest version. Update the version and build variables in the following command to get the desired version:

    `version=3.x`
    `build=3`
    `mkdir ~/temp`
    `cd ~/temp`
    `wget https://cmake.org/files/v$version/cmake-$version.$build.tar.gz`
    `tar -xzvf cmake-$version.$build.tar.gz`
    `cd cmake-$version.$build/`

3. Install the extracted source by running:

    `./bootstrap`
    `make -j4`
    `sudo make install`

4. Test your new cmake version.
